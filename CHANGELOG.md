# Starlark

## 0.11 (Jan 19, 2024)

* `UnpackValue` is no longer implemented for `Vec`. Instead, `UnpackList`, `UnpackTuple` or `UnpackListOrTuple` can be used.
* Added `call_stack()` function.
* Removed `experimental_regex()` function.
* Switched from `anyhow::Error` and `Diagnostic` to `starlark::Error` in many APIs.
* Fix `repr()` for enums.
* Various improvements to [DAP](https://microsoft.github.io/debug-adapter-protocol/) support.
* Add a few more traits and functions to `SortedMap`.
* Disable the legacy type representation, types as strings such as `"bool"` are no longer supported. See the revised [typing documentation](https://github.com/facebookexperimental/starlark-rust/blob/main/docs/types.md).

## 0.10.0 (Oct 16, 2023)

There were over eight hundred commits since the last release, with the main areas of change including:

* Make it work on 32 bit architectures, including WASM.
* Introduce `starlark_syntax`, `starlark_lsp`, `starlark_bin` crates.
* Expose the AST through `starlark_syntax`.
* No longer require nightly Rust compiler.
* Change how types are represented, e.g. `{str.type, ""}` becomes `dict[str, typing.Any]`.
* Add static type checking options.
* Support f-strings extension.

## 0.9.0 (June 5, 2023)

There were over one thousand commits since the last release, with the main areas of change including:

* Add `Module.names` to get the symbols in a module.
* Change iterators on `Value` to support reduced stack space and enable future garbage collection, removing `iterate_collect` and `with_iterator`.
* Improve DAP (debugger) support.
* Improve the performance and fix a few bugs in `%` string formatting.
* Introduce `StarlarkTypeRepr` as a trait for things that have a type representation.
* Optimise and increase standards conformance of the Starlark standard library.
* Rework how `List`/`Dict` are specified, making their internals private and introducing `ListRef`/`DictRef` for pointers to them.
* Add `AllocStruct`, `AllocList` and `AllocDict` as helpers to allocate the various types more efficiently.
* Remove the `dedupe` Starlark function.
* Integrate with the `allocative` crate to support the `Allocative` trait.
* Add more `Trace` implementations.
* Support type annotations on assignments.
* Make `Module.loads` also return the `FileSpan`.

* Add support for integers greater than 32 bits.
* Move to a separate `starlark_map` crate for `SmallMap` and optimise it.
* Require the `starlark_type!` macro.
* Change `Module.extra_v` to be `Value<'v>`.
* Expose `FrozenHeap` from `Freezer` and `GlobalsBuilder`.
* Remove `Value::new_int`.
* In `starlark_module` functions must be more explicit - return `anyhow::Result`, have an explicit `'v` parameter, explicit `heap`/`eval` arguments.
* Add `StringValueLike` to cover string types that are values.
* Change the `json` extension method to be `json.encode` and `json.decode`.
* Support stable Rust.
* Inline all the relevant pieces of the `gazebo` library.
* Change all `starlark_module` annotations to be `#[starlark(...)]`, `#[starlark(require = named)]` for name-only parameters.
* Many performance optimisations.
* Change the API for profiling and add new profiling features.
* Make the `starlark` binary spawn the REPL by default.
* Many improvements and API changes to the documentation generation code.
* Many improvements to the LSP code.
* Add a `Dialect` option to enable types.

## 0.8.0 (May 9, 2022)

* Redo `StringValue` and `FrozenStringValue` as aliases for `ValueTyped<StarlarkStr>` and `FrozenValueTyped<StarlarkStr>` respectively.
* Add more trait implementations for `ValueTyped`.
* Format call stack reports more like Python.
* Implement `FromStr` for `ProfileMode`.
* Impelement `Eq` for `BorrowHashed` .
* Minor optimisations throughout.
* Better error messages, e.g for `1 << -2`.
* Add `StarlarkValue::bit_not` for the bit-negation operator.
* In the REPL print non-`None` values.
* Add `get_index` to `SmallSet`.
* Add a `Regex` type - note this is likely to change API in the next release and is not considered stable.
* Upgrade dependencies.

## 0.7.1 (April 13, 2022)

* Add `MethodsBuilder::alloc`.

## 0.7.0 (March 22, 2022)

There have been many changes since the last release, focused on performance and features. These changes caused a number of API changes and behavioural changes, the most significant of which are listed below.

* Add support for validators when freezing.

## 0.6.0 (November 22, 2021)

There have been many changes since the last release, focused on performance, documentation, type safety and profiling. These changes caused a number of API changes and behavioural changes, the most significant of which are listed below.

* Support for newer versions of `anyhow`.
* Some error messages contain "did you mean" suggestions.
* Addition of a bytecode interpreter, with associated performance gains.
* Constant propagation and speculative execution during compilation.
* Removed mutability around the file loader and `set_loader`.
* Several new forms of profiling, making use of the new `extra_memory` function.

* Changes around function invocation, in particular `Arguments` is now opaque.
* Changes around `ConstFrozenString`, which is now `StarlarkStrN`.
* Add `OwnedFrozenValue::owner`.
* Add `derive` support for `Freeze`.
* Add more Starlark typed wrappers, such as `StringValue` and `ValueTyped`.
* Make tuples and lists opaque types, with new functions for allocating them (e.g. `alloc_tuple`).
* Make all Starlark types implement `Display` in preference to `collect_repr`.
* Support for documentation annotations on all types.

## 0.5.0 (August 26, 2021)

There have been many changes since the last release, primarily focused on performance (up to 100x in some benchmarks). These changes caused a number of API changes, the most significant of which are listed below.

* Rename the `starlark_module` crate to `starlark_derive`.
* Rename the `walk` methods to `trace` to align to standard GC literature.
* Add `derive` for `Trace`.
* Add `StarlarkAttrs` derivation and scheme.

* More complete `SmallMap` API.
* Three profiling modes, heap, flame and statement.
* Changes to `invoke` to take an `Arguments` structure.
* Changed to iteration APIs.
* Many semantic improvements to non-ASCII strings.
* Refinements to types and how they work.
* Mark a few additional APIs as `unsafe`.
* Use the `gazebo` `Coerce` trait extensively, in particular required for some of the `starlark_value` macros.
* Delete `dict.copy` and `list.copy`, since they aren't in the Starlark spec.
* `UnpackValue` no longer takes a `heap` argument.

## 0.4.0 (April 6, 2021)

* Move repo to https://github.com/facebookexperimental/starlark-rust.
* Switch to a garbage collector.
* Add `#[starlark_module]` proc-macro.
* Significant rewrite of most code, changing most APIs.

## 0.3.2

* Commits and tag exist in https://github.com/indygreg/starlark-rust.
* Changed dependency versions from `X.Y.Z` to `X.Y` to allow adopting newer point releases.

* Fixed compiler warnings on Rust 1.56+ related to semicolons in macro expansions.

## 0.3.1 and before

* The code was developed at https://github.com/google/starlark-rust.
